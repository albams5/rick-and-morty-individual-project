## 📖Journal 

*DAY 1:

- Create the basic HTML structure with Bootstrap. Include a header and footer. List the first 20 episodes and a central space for characters.

*DAY 2:

- Create a button and logic to load the next 20 episodes. Edit the color palette to match the theme.

*DAY 3:

- Create buttons and logic to load the latest episodes and, when clicked, display the first episodes again. Implement a scrollbar and edit its design. Include basic episode information in the central div. Create a function (cleanCard) to prevent the accumulation of episode information in the central div.

*DAY 4:

- Develop logic to display basic information about characters in Bootstrap cards.

*DAY 5:

- Develop a function to show extra information about the characters. Center the cards in the div.

*DAY 6:

- Create a function to display the episodes in which a particular character has participated. Attempt to solve a bug (character card does not disappear when clicking on another episode).

*DAY 7:

- Bug fixed. Create a function that takes you from the character card to the episode where they appear by clicking on the card itself. Add location to character information and the addEventListener to display locations.

*DAY 8:

- Change the font for the header, add an image and text for the web's initial state. Create types.ts and import the types (previously all in the same .ts file). Define all types for variables and functions.

*DAY 9:

- Add styles to episode divs.

*DAY 10:

- Fix the location info section.
## 📝Lessons Learned


1. Usage and handling of APIs.

2. Usage and handling of TypeScript. Gain confidence with types and enums.

3. Usage and handling of Bootstrap and its classes.


## 🚧Issues

1. Realize that when creating types, the name must match the API name: episode_code vs episode in the API.

2. Bootstrap design: Limiting but at the same time quick, harmonious, and responsive.

3. Ensure that when showing a specific character's card, clicking on an episode makes this card disappear.
